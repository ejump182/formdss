Setting Default Views For User Groups (for Webmasters)
=======================================================

As a webmaster, you can currently (at the time of writing - Nov.18, 2014) set the default view of a form's entries for **all users** by going to the 'Entries in *your-form-name*'' > *Edit Screen* tab > *Entries To Display* tab.

We're introducing the ability for you to set a default view of a form's entries for a **user group** as opposed to everyone.  Just select the group that you want to add a default view for and the corresponding default view, and save your changes.

**PLEASE NOTE:**  In the event that a user belongs to multiple groups and there are default views set for each group, an order of precedence is done.  The *first group* in the list of default views that the user belongs to will be the default view that is set for that user.

Additionally, if a user group does not have permission to see the form (or certain entries in it), and there is a default view set that allows for the viewing of such entries in the form, the permission settings will take precedence and nothing will be shown to the user/user group.
