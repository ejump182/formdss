	 * The IcmsSimpleRss class contains feed level data and options
	 *
	 * There are two ways that you can create a new IcmsSimpleRss object. The first
	 * is by passing a feed URL as a parameter to the IcmsSimpleRss constructor
	 * (as well as optionally setting the cache expiry - The cache location is automatically set
	 * as ICMS_CACHE_PATH). This will initialise the whole feed with all of the default settings, and you
	 * can begin accessing methods and properties immediately.
	 *
	 * The second way is to create the IcmsSimpleRss object with no parameters
	 * at all. This will enable you to set configuration options. After setting
	 * them, you must initialise the feed using $feed->init(). At that point the
	 * object's methods and properties will be available to you.
	 *
	 * @access public
	 * @param string $feed_url This is the URL you want to parse.
	 * @param int $cache_duration This is the number of seconds that you want to store the cache file for.
